# weekend-4-assignment

We're switching up our client-side this weekend with Angular! Our focus will be on getting comfortable with what Angular can do for us, so most of our effort will be on client-side JavaScript and, hopefully, experimenting with CSS.

This weekend's application will be a gallery of 6 or more pictures of significance to you. When someone clicks on a picture, they should see a brief synopsis of why you chose to display that photo. Users can also heart/thumbs up/favorite your photo as many times as they want; you'll need to keep track of how many times it was clicked.

When you're done, host this on Heroku!

## Technologies

- Node/Express - to serve your files
- Angular - client-side logic
- CSS - flex your style muscles
- Heroku - to make your site available to the world

## Steps:
- [x] Create files needed for base mode.
- [x] Place at least six pictures on the page.

- [x] Description of the photos on-click.
- [x] Write thumbs up buttons.
- [x] On click, synopsis should appear.
- [x] Style with CSS/Boostrap.
## Hard mode:
- [ ] More bootstrap
- [ ] Counter to keep track of how many clicks
## Pro mode:
- [ ] Create a form that will take comments for each photo. Display comments when button is clicked.
